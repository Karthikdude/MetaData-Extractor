            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Understanding Metadata</h2>
            <p class="lead">Metadata is essentially data about other data. It provides additional context and details about the file that isn't visible at first glance. This includes information such as the date a photo was taken, the author of a document, or technical details about a video file.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">For images, metadata might reveal the camera model, exposure settings, and even the GPS location where the photo was captured. Documents can include details like the author, software used, and document revisions. Audio and video files contain metadata about recording equipment, duration, and format specifics.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Understanding this metadata can enhance your digital asset management and ensure privacy by disclosing potentially sensitive information before sharing files. Our tool makes it easy to view and understand all this hidden data in one place.</p>
